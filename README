== 1. Introduction: what is wLex? ==

wLex is a tool for formatting and manipulating the legal acts of the
Republic of Estonia.

wLex came to being because of necessity. When the Law of Obligations
Act was passed , it was almost impossible to read it without some kind
of table of contents (the Act contains 1068 paragraphs). And since I
didn't want to spend money on buying a book version of the Act, I
wrote a script that helped me create the contents. Later, the script
underwent several improvements, and currently does the following:

- reformats the texts of the acts to standards-compliant XHTML
  1.0 (or at least tries to; some acts in eRT contain so much
  invalid HTML that wLex just can't figure out how to fix them);
- adds tables of contents to any acts that conform to the formatting
  rules of Estonian legal acts;
- facilitates one-click comparison of different versions of any given
  act provided that the older versions are present in the database of
  electronic Riigi Teataja (the e-version of the Official Journal);

wLex is written in Perl and consists of a single script and a few
other files.  wLex uses wget for connecting to eRT, tidy for
cleaning up the html of received acts, and diff for preparing the
comparison tables.  It also needs cat, and a cgi-enabled web
server.  The system is designed and tested on Linux and Apache.

wLex is free software licensed under GNU GPL Version 2. You are free
to use, modify and distribute it as you like, but you have to keep all
copyright notes, and if you modify the program, you'll have to change
the $progID string in the script so everybody would know they are
working with a modified version.


== 2. Installation and configuration ==

- Make sure you have apache, perl, wget, tidy, diff, and cat up and running.

- Unpack the distribution archive somewhere into the directory tree of
  your web server. In case you fail to keep the original access rights
  of all files and folders, make sure that the scripts are writeable
  only by yourself (chmod go-w) and that the subdirectories are
  writeable by the web server (chmod go+w). Note that the folder where
  the wlex.pl script is located must also be chmod go-w.

- Create wLex configuration file (config.pl) using sample-config.pl as
  an example, and edit it according to the instructions provided therein. 

- Test your installation by directing your web browser to your
  wLex installation. If something doesn't work, try figuring out
  what's wrong.  You may also contact the author, who **might**
  have time to help you.

- Enjoy. If you modify the script any way, please also modify the
  $progID string in wlex.pl, so that your users would know
  they're working with a modified version.  You may (although you
  don't have to) also let me know what you changed and how.

- If you want to change the front page, modify wlex.htm. If you want
  to change the visual style, modify style.css. These modifications
  alone do not require that you change the $progID strings as long as
  you do not distribute the modified version of wLex.

== 4. Special thanks ==

- Eric Bednarz (http://tagsoup.com) for examples in his cookbook that
  helped me hack the CSS in order to make the service also usable to
  the poor Windows users who haven't yet switched to a decent browser.
